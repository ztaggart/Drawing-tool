# Drawing-tool
A basic drawing tool to create, save, and edit 300x300 pixel pictures. The user picks a color, size, and shape of paintbrush to use and is able to drag or click the mouse to create drawings. If the user clicks on the main drawing canvas, a shape with the current color and size is drawn at that position. The user can then change the size of the paintbrush by either entering a value, or incrementing it by the spinner. The shape of the brush is changed by a drop down menu. The color button can be clicked which creates a pop up color wheel menu in order to choose a paintbrush color. This was mostly created using the java swing library. 

# Installing
All .java files are available to download. To set up, download src folder and place into a new java project in the desired compiler.
Alternatively, the .jar file is available to download to just use the drawing software.
